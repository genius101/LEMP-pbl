In this project we will implement a similar stack, but with an alternative Web Server - NGINX, which is also very popular and widely used by many websites in the Internet.

In LAMP-pbl we implemented a similar stack but with Apache Server instead of NGINX Web Server. In the following steps I would show you steps alongside screenshots of implementation with NGINX Web Server


Step 1 â€“ Installing the Nginx Web Server


a) Install Nginx Web Server and check for status

i)	sudo apt update
ii)	sudo apt install nginx
iii)	sudo systemctl status nginx
